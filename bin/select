# AppleScript tips/notes:
#
# -- not quite right (doesn't work with relative paths)
# -- e.g. log FileExists("foo.txt")
# on FileExists(f)
#   tell application "System Events"
#     return exists file f
#   end tell
# end FileExists
#
# Need the current working directory?
#
# set pwd to do shell script "pwd"
#
# Files, aliases, and converting between Unix-style and Apple-style paths is ... weird. See

#
# (Note that this is a (POSIX path ...) command as well as (POSIX file ...).)
#
# Use "log" to dump output for debugging
