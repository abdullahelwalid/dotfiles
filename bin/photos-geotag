# EXIF time is assumed to match computer time by default. That is, if
# the time on the camera is 14:34, the time on the computer is also
# 14:34. You can fix/adjust this with the second argument, but you
# should only need to do this if the photos were taken in a different
# time zone than the machine that's running exiftool.

# It's safe to run this command multiple times until the geotags match
# up with reality; exiftool writes separate "GPS" time stamps to the
# metadata, while leaving the original times alone.

# Debugging
#
# exiftool -time:all                       # view time metadata
# exiftool -overwrite_original -gps:all= . # remove gps metadata
