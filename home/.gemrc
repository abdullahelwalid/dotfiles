# Configures gem to put binaries into /usr/local/bin, which should make 
# it possible to install all gems as non-root.  (Libraries will go into
# /Library/Ruby, which can already be written to by non-root users.)
# See

# for more information.
# 
# To install libraries into another directory as well, use something
# like
#
#   --install-dir /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8
#
# (Though then you need to make sure GEM_HOME points to this directory.)
gem: --bindir /usr/local/bin
