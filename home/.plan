        Books: These are great to fill empty wall units.
	Designers keep stacks of these on reserve for this
	purpose.  Watch for sales sponsored by local
	libraries that need to clear stacks for new books.
	The covers of the books can relate to the color
	scheme of the room.  Books also look nice stacked on
	a coffee table.
