The contents of this directory probably come from:

    $ git config --global init.templatedir
    
The default hooks directory location (which contains some sample
hooks) is `/usr/share/git-core/templates`.  (May be different if using
`brew` or similar.)

See <http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks> for more
information on what hooks are available.

Note that hooks must have the executable bit set for git to consider
them!
