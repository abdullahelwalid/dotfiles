# Import All Settings

First, install the plugin [Solarized
Themes](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12784-solarized-themes).
(This is not included as part of the settings, for some reason...)

File | Import Settings... | [Choose settings.zip]

(Requires IBM Plex Sans font.)

# Import Color Scheme

(Does not require a plugin, but only changes the colours of the
"source code" area.)

Preferences | Editor | Color Scheme | Cog | Import Scheme... | [Choose *.icls]
