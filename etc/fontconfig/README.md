Fixes rendering of Helvetica.

For some reason some Linux systems come with a horrible bitmapped
version of Helvetica, and for some reason this has a particularly poor
interaction with Firefox. (Chrome seems immune.)

This maps the font "Helvetica" to something else, and needs to be
installed in `~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf`.

for more info.
