Repeat to cycle between the center, top, and\nbottom of the screen.\n\nThis is similar to the built-in Editor:Scroll To Cursor but adds the support for scrolling to\nthe top and bottom.  Also, as of Atom 0.84, Editor:Scroll To Cursor does not scroll the cursor\nto the center of the screen if the cursor is already visible.\n\nIt is bound to `ctrl-l` which overrides the built-in.\n\nOnce Atom's core is in a public repository, I'd like to propose this get moved into the core to replace Scroll To Cursor since it is a simple but useful superset of it.\n",
